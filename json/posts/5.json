{"description":"<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nFURNACE CREEK, Calif. \u2014 For Death Valley, a place that embraces its extremes, this has long been an affront: As furnace-hot as it gets here, it could not lay claim to being the hottest place on earth. That honor, as it were, has gone since 1922 to a city on the northwestern tip of Libya.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nUntil now. After a yearlong investigation by a team of climate scientists, the World Meteorological Organization, the climate agency of the United Nations, announced this fall that it was throwing out a reading of 136.4 degrees claimed by the city of Al Aziziyah on Sept. 13, 1922. It made official what anyone who has soldiered through a Death Valley summer afternoon here could attest to. There is no place hotter in the world. A 134-degree reading registered on July 10, 1913, at Greenland Ranch here is now the official world record.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nAnd while people were not quite jumping up and down at the honor, the 134-degree reading has inspired the kind of civic pride that for most communities might come with having a winning Little League baseball team.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CFor those of us who survive here in the summer, it was no surprise that it\u2019s the hottest place on the world,\u201D said Charlie Callaghan, a Death Valley National Park ranger who personally recorded a 129-degree day here a few years back.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe opening wall panel in a new exhibition at the National Park Service visitor center off Highway 190 has been unveiled with a <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/deva/faqs.htm\">burst of superlatives</a>: \u201CHottest. Driest. Lowest.\u201D (Lowest refers to a spot in Death Valley, Badwater Basin, which at 282 feet below sea level is the lowest place in North America.)        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nPromotional leaflets that still boast of Death Valley as being merely the hottest place in the United States are being rewritten, and resort owners say they are girding for a crush of heat-seeking visitors come next summer. There is even talk of having an official 100-year celebration of the record-setting measurement next July.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CIt\u2019s about time for science, but I think we all knew it was coming,\u201D said Randy Banis, the editor of <a target=\"_\" href=\"http://DeathValley.com\">DeathValley.com</a>, an online newsletter promoting the valley. \u201CYou don\u2019t underestimate Death Valley. Most of us enthusiasts are proud that the extremes that we have known about at Death Valley are indeed the most harsh on earth.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nStill, the designation was a momentous event among this nation\u2019s community of climatologists \u2014 or, as some of them proudly refer to themselves, \u201Cweather geeks\u201D \u2014 the climax of a long debate set off by <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=2\">a blog item</a> written by Christopher C. Burt, a meteorologist with Weather Underground. Mr. Burt cited numerous reasons to be suspicious of the Libyan claim, which he described in an interview the other day as \u201Ccompletely garbage.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CThe more we looked at it, the more obvious it appeared to be an error,\u201D he said.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nMr. Burt brought his blog post to the attention of members of the World Meteorological Organization. Randall S. Cerveny, a geology professor at Arizona State University who holds the title rapporteur of climate extremes for the World Climate Organization, appointed a committee of 13 climatologists, including himself and Mr. Burt, to resolve what can often be tricky disputes.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CThere are a lot of places that do like these records,\u201D he said. \u201CIt can be a source of pride for that country or a source of contention for other countries. Politics unfortunately is going to play a role sometime in the determining of these records.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nIt took a year to investigate the claim \u2014 the inquiry was hampered by the revolution in Libya, which resulted in the temporary disappearance of a Libyan scientist who was central to the work. The <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/dx3vn9k\">final report</a> found five reasons to disqualify the Libya claim, including questionable instruments, an inexperienced observer who made the reading and the fact that the reading was anomalous for that region and in the context of other temperatures reported in Libya that day.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CThe W.M.O. assessment is that the highest recorded surface temperature of 56.7 degrees C (134 degrees F) was measured on 10 July 1913\u201D in Death Valley, the report said.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe announcement was made on Sept. 11, the same day as the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, and thus drew little notice.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThough it is easy to forget on days when it is so hot that people dare not step out of their cars, part of the allure of Death Valley has always been \u2014 besides the staggering beauty of its canyons, mountains and sunsets \u2014 the sheer challenge of visiting it.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CI think there might be such a thing as a weather tourist,\u201D Mr. Burt said. \u201CI may be one.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nBen Cassell, who runs the Panamint Springs Resort on the west side of Death Valley, said that even before the long-awaited official recognition, his summer rooms typically were booked up by the spring, mainly by Europeans seeking temperatures they cannot find back home.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CThe Europeans love to visit in the summer when it is the hottest,\u201D he said. \u201CThe Americans tend to go in the spring for the flowers.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe European tourists, he said, \u201Cdefinitely are looking for the extreme.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CWe get people who get upset that today it\u2019s 120, and the day before they got here it was 121,\u201D he said. \u201CThey want to have bragging rights.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nMr. Callaghan, who would know, said there most certainly was a difference between 115 degrees and, say, 125 degrees.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CYou kind of get used to the 115s, the 120s,\u201D he said. \u201COnce it gets above 120, 125, it\u2019s just downright miserable. It\u2019s just so excruciatingly hot. You don\u2019t walk outside your air-conditioned car or your office. You don\u2019t want to have jewelry on because you feel the burning on the ears. Your eyes, your eyebrows, feel real hot.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nTruth be told, it was hard to think of Death Valley in all its hot glory on a visit the weekend before Christmas. The thermometer outside the Ranch at Furnace Creek \u2014 which measures up to 140 \u2014 read a chilly 55 degrees. People could be seen on canyon hiking trails clothed in scarfs and parkas.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CThere\u2019s no normal or abnormal,\u201D said Bob Greenberg, a ranger on duty. \u201CBut if it gets anywhere near freezing, you hear a lot of whining around here.\u201D        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nFor what it is worth, Mr. Burt said he had issues as well with the Death Valley claim of 134 degrees, and suspects it may be wrong. \u201CIt\u2019s anomalous, even for Death Valley,\u201D he said.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nBut no matter. Even if 134-Death Valley goes the way of 136.4-Libya, the temperature has most assuredly reached 129 degrees here in Furnace Creek at least three times, one of them recorded by Mr. Callaghan. And 129 is just as much a world record as 134.        </p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\u201CDeath Valley would still win, so to speak, even if the 134 was erroneous,\u201D Mr. Burt said.        </p>"}
